# Weather Or Not

This project is to develop a website for the artist Adamma Anwen Lloyd, with the goal of showcasing her work and attracting potential clients or buyers. We aim to include a gallery page with high-quality images of her work, an about the artist page and a contact form for enquiries or purchases. 

As far as the user is concerned, they should be able to view Adamma's work and contact her for any commissions or purchases. This should be covered within our intended site.

In terms of design, there should be a cohesive colour scheme and set of styles across the whole site to reiterate the artist's brand. Site layout should enhance rather than impede the user experience to give a welcoming, intuitive feel. Finally, the site layout should be responsive to enable easy navigation on all devices.

As can be seen from the project board, the completed sprint was composed of 17 separate items. Having used the MoSCoW approach to prioritisation, 10 were classified as "Must-Have" making up less than 60% of the tasks as recommended. The rest of the first sprint was made up of "Should-Have", "Could-Have" and bug fixes.
The project backlog contains several "Could-Have" user stories and two "Won't Have" items.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**

Navigation is provided via a bootstrap navbar. CSS code has been added to underline menu items on hover and tint the navbar for each page. Font Awesome icons have been added to each menu item to add visual clues.

### Responsive Testing

Alongside the built in Bootstrap responsive CSS, media queries were used throughout our own CSS to provide a consistent user experience. Chrome dev tools were used frequently to test the site at standard screen sizes and the site was manually viewed on laptops, tablets and phones.

### Validator Testing

- HTML

  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [_W3C validator_](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://mbriscoe.github.io/Ethereal-Expressions)

- CSS
  - No errors were found with our own CSS code when passing through the official Jigsaw validator. However, there were many errors found in the Bootstrap CSS code, which is a normal result.

## Bugs
All bug fixes were dealt with efficiently and cleanly.
- BUG: contact page width issue
- BUG: Footer overlapping content
- BUG: Shading display on gallery page
